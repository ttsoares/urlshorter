## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React Hook Form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form) - Fine grain form management
- [tailwindcss/forms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tailwindcss/forms) - Provides a basic reset for form styles

### What I learned

- A lot of exercises about relative/absolute CSS positioning.
- How to really control SVGs properties with Tailwind classes.

### Continued development

- Again this solution is not a "fluid design", it really only looks good at 1440px and 375px. It would be a scary challenge to make it nice in all resolutions...

### Useful resources

- Documentation of the React Hook Form was very helpful.
